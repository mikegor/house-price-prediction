Basic data analysis of this dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). I used here technics I have learned on data science course(https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python?version=5). Regression techniques apllied here are quite simple but they gave me overview how different algorithms work and how should data be prepared for particular one.
